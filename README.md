# Unsupervised Pattern Discovery in Astrophysical Emission Data

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify structured regions in high-dimensional spatial emission data. The goal is to discover latent patterns without labeled examples, a common challenge in both scientific and industrial machine learning applications.

## Problem Framing
The dataset consists of simulated emission maps where manual labeling is impractical. Unsupervised learning is therefore used to extract meaningful structures directly from the data distribution.

## Methods (High-Level)
- Data preprocessing and patch-based feature extraction
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA and UMAP
- Clustering using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models
- Evaluation using clustering metrics and qualitative inspection

## Status
Refactoring MSc research project into an industry-ready machine learning portfolio.
